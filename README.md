# Financial-Returns-Distribution-Analyzer
Create a tool that fits multiple probability distributions (Normal, Student's t, Skewed distributions) to real financial data using maximum likelihood estimation. Implement goodness-of-fit tests, calculate moments (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis), and compare distribution parameters across different assets.
